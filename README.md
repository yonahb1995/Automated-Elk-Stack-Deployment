# Automated ELK Stack Deployment
Project 1 of Cybersecurity Boot Camp

I used the files in this repository to configure the attached network diagram.

I used these yaml files to deploy ELK, filebeat, and metricbeat to the ELKvm and WEBvms respectively.

(pull yaml files and add them to this repository)

I created this network in order to expose and moniter a load-balanced instance of DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application).
